When pushing new info to GitHub using the following template:
Git Add and Commit

git commit -m "add .gitignore, cmds to readme"
git push origin main

*created authors.csv and books.csv

Created each of the sql folders that corresponded with teach sql that was required in the project.

Conclusion:

The core components of starting a project are the same. Depending on the tools you are using, you will have to adjust and seek guidance. I rely on google and AI to help me understand and get through these projects.
